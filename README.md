# PM2.5-Predictor
🌫️ Beijing PM2.5 Spatial Interpolation Dashboard
KNN-based Air Quality Estimation using Multi-Station Sensor Data

This project performs spatial interpolation of PM2.5 values from multiple Beijing air-quality monitoring stations using K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN).
A Streamlit dashboard is included to upload custom data, view it, train the KNN and generate interpolated PM2.5 values on a map.

## Dependencies

Create a Python environment using Python 3.9+

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run the Streamlit Dashboard

`streamlit run app.py`
